          The rhinoceros gets its name from one of its most notable features: its horns. The word rhinoceros come from
          the
          Greek words rhino meaning “nose” and ceros meaning “horn.” The number of horns that a rhino has varies on
          the
          species. The two African species (the black rhino and the white rhino) and the Sumatran rhino have two
          horns, while
          the Javan rhino and one-horned rhino have one horn.
